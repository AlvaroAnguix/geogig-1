Feature: Create Repository
	Creating a repository on the server is done through the "/{repository}/init" command
	The command must be executed using the HTTP PUT method
	If a repository with the provided name already exists, then a 409 "Conflict" error code shall be returned
	If the command succeeds, the response status code is 201 "Created"
	And the reponse's XML body is as follows:
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<response>
	  <success>true</success>
	  <repo>
	    <name>newrepo</name>
	    <atom:link xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" rel="alternate" href="http://localhost:8182/newrepo.xml" type="application/xml"/>
	  </repo>
	</response>
  
      
  Scenario: Verify wrong HTTP method issues 405 "Method not allowed"
    Given There is an empty multirepo server
     When I call "GET /repo1/init"
     Then the response status should be '405'
      And the response allowed methods should be "PUT"
      
  Scenario: Verify trying to create an existing repo issues 409 "Conflict"
    Given There is a default multirepo server
     When I call "PUT /repo1/init"
     Then the response status should be '409'
      And the response ContentType should be "application/xml"
      And the xpath "/response/success/text()" equals "false"
      And the xpath "/response/error/text()" equals "Cannot run init on an already initialized repository."

  Scenario: Create repository on empty server
    Given There is an empty multirepo server
     When I call "PUT /repo1/init"
     Then the response status should be '200'
      And the response ContentType should be "application/xml"
      And the xpath "/response/success/text()" equals "true"
      And the xpath "/response/repo/name/text()" equals "repo1"
      And the xpath "/response/repo/atom:link/@href" equals "/repo1.xml"
